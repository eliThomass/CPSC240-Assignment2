# CPSC240-Assignment2
addition and subtraction in x86 Assembly

## *Addition Section*

-     Design a 16-bit addition program "addition.asm", and use assembly language to realize the function of the following C++ instructions. NOTE: variable sizes and program functions should be equivalent to C/C++ instructions. 
    	unsigned short num1 = 0xFEDC; 	// use dw to declare 16-bit variable 
    	unsigned short num2 = 0x1234; 	// use dw to declare 16-bit variable 
    	unsigned int sum = 0; 	// use dd to declare 32-bit variable 
    	sum = int(num1 + num2); 

## *Subtration Section*

-     Design a 16-bit subtraction program "subtraction.asm", and use assembly language to realize the function of the following C++ instructions. NOTE: variable sizes and program functions should be equivalent to C/C++ instructions. 
    	signed short num1 = 0x1234;	// use dw to declare 16-bit variable 
    	signed short num2 = 0xFEDC;	// use dw to declare 16-bit variable 
    	signed int dif = 0; 	// use dd to declare 32-bit variable 
    	dif = int(num1 - num2);
